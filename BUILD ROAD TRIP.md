In this im not actually doing a road trip. It's more of a play on words of like, the road to getting the car *built*. Plans are to hit 400 WHP like skyshadex on yt.

HELLO HELLO FIRST ENTRY. Okay basically this is not a performance entry at all. Right now it's winter and it's shitty snowy. There's like one and a million things about the car that I've noticed that bother me like chipped paint, cracked leather, cracked bumper yadiya and I will address everything but right now, I want to address the biggest elephant in the room which is, GDI. I will probably write something about this in my notes but from the research I've read, the 2015 VT gets a good amount of carbon buildup which can lead to knock, bad fuel economy and loss of performance amongst other things. As it sits my VT is at like 176.5 thousand km and I doubt any of the past owners have taken that point of failure into account and have done something about it. For some reason in Montreal, NO ONE does this service (carbon cleaning). I had been looking for like 3 weeks straight for a place that does korean walnut or dry-ice blasting but to no avail. Luckily, I called this european car shop called Strasse Autowerks, and they quoted me for 560 + tax and I have an appointment on the 20th @ 10 AM. I'm also booked at a Hyundai dealership for some recalls on my platform for ABS and underbody corrosion as well as normal oil change and inspection for like 120. I've also went ahead and bought the tools and parts required for spark plug replacement because I have no idea when was the last time they had been replaced. The spark plugs are some HKS M40XL for like 110$ from N75 motorsports (heard theyre busted). I'm pretty sure the spark plugs can also accrue carbon on top of just being worn out so just being safe. Han right now is still kind of rough, like I was driving it today and like it idles funny and riding feels like I'm constantly riding on gravel. I think that doing all of these maintenance services will drastically improve the feel of the car and ideally I want to have the car feel brand new. We'll see. (As of writing this SPARK PLUGS ARE COMING TMR WWW).

Okay so, I've been driving right and hit a MASSIVE pothole on the highway fml. Basically, I think this was already an issue but now it more noticeable but, the car at anything over 40km/h will stutter very slightly but enough to be annoying. Like it just makes the driving experience not fun. I know it's not the engine because it does this even when I ride the clutch so it's not the trans or engine (good thing). I'm looking at a set of sparcos and avan wheels on FB for 700 (actual steal) so I think the plan is : get those in like end february, install and get them balanced. While I install them, I'll take a look at the suspension and check what is out of whack. I really don't want to get new coilovers just yet because those are mad expensive and I wanted to do shifter upgrade and exhaust first (maybe exhaust first). I'm hoping it's just bad bushings and tie rods. If replacing those parts does the trick I'd be mega happy because Ideally I'd want to do coilovers in like fall or something. Also I was looking at the email I got from N75 and like, tuning will run me up 2k ðŸ˜…. 2k canadian though and I get 3 free revisions so like lowkey not horrible. I don't need a tune just yet but like when I do FMIC and WMI, that'll run me up like a solid 4k. Everything is coming together but DAMN that shit expensive. Rn though, mainly looking at wheels, and short throw shifters, nothing crazy crazy. Update coming soon `o7`.

OK. So considering my financial situation and the way I've started prioritizing mods I think my summer plans have considerably changed. I've been looking more and more into tools more than parts. I've been liking the idea of doing preventative maintenance and aesthetic mods more than performance fun parts as of lately. I think if I ever will end up tacking performance mods on the car, it'll be after I'm comfortable doing so, I want a tasteful and daily-able build before I make it any faster. I bought the Targas about 3 weeks back now and I put up my tires on marketplace this morning. I could still use them but they'd stretch. I though they we're 17 inches and that they we're old random all season tires but the tires I got with the car are surprisingly good. I was shocked when I saw the writing on the rubber yesterday saying "Khumo Ecsta PS71" and the number "3822" (might be wrong on the week). Only issue is I was aiming to get 235/40/18 and not 215/40/18 as on 18x8s, they'd stretch. So while they're in good condition, might as well throw em up on marketplace to soften the blow when I get some pirellis P zeros. As of right now im more concerned on school and gas money more than anything, but when the semester comes to an end I'd be looking at these changes (in order):

1. Milwaukee m18 impact wrench (mid torque)
2. olsatools CR-MO 1/2 inch stubby impact sockets
3. Tires + balance 
4. Short throw shifter + transmission fluid fllush + nice knob

Then, mid summer I'd like to redo the whole front end. What I mean by this is, I'd take apart the entire front end of the car and make a bunch of aesthetic, preventative and performance related changes. I would first address the bumper sag by doing the mod in [[Bumper Sag]], Then while I'm at it, Id do the mesh grill to complete the front bumper and also to show off the new Radiator I'd be getting. While changing the radiator, I'd do a coolant flush and while I have access to it, I'd change the water pump (and maybe AC compressor if I see it's old) and serpentine belt. While having access to the pulleys, I'd change out the heavy pulleys to some nice lightweight pulleys. To then really complete the look of the front end, I'd put up my headlights on ebay or marketplace, to afford some specD aftermarket headlights. AFTER ALL OF THIS, I'd start considering FBO mods if I still have time and money, like exhaust, FMIC (depending if I can get away with getting one without a tune) etc etc. Mind you, I don't know if the old owner has beat this car, and I want to experience it as if it were new (or close to it). I think this is a fair and frugal way to treat my first car, the first summer I've had my hands on it. Plus, as said before, it'll give me confidence to do more stuff to it while not being completely boring (no insane power gain), because at least it'll look way better.

#### 4/16/2025
OK SO, I got my hands on a little bit of money after having sold my tires and bought some tools and upgrades that I will detail specifically in [[4-16-2025 |The logs]]. Now that that is all bought, I have to pay off school, a toll bridge fee, my mom, taxes and my credit card so I'll stop splurging for a little while. I have a Lugia V #186 full-art that is worth a pretty penny that I want to get graded by CGC and sold on ebay ad im thinking I could get atleast 500 from that and another 1500 from the bourse (hopefully) which would again soften the financial hit when I get some tires. I'm looking at getting a few more things in the near future for maintenance and potential performance that being ;

parts:
- Serpentine belt
- Water pump
- MAYBE lightweight pulleys (depending on budget)
- Mesh Grill
- New coolant

tools:
- Spill proof funnel
- Set of chrome vanadium sockets with ratchet (marketplace find picking up tomorrow morning)
- Impact socket set

Then in the moderately far future I'm looking at doing body work and suspension work after I get my tires taken care of. I now am getting a good set of tools so suspension work (which was impossible with what I had before) is now something to consider especially with my bigass wrench I have now. I'd love to do what I wrote down in [[Suspension Rebuild]] paired with a cool alignment to make driving feel better and most importantly safer. Pretty sure my front shocks are gone and that my tie rods are gone too.
