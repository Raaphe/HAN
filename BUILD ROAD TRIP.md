HELLO HELLO FIRST ENTRY. Okay basically this is not a performance entry at all. Right now it's winter and it's shitty snowy. There's like one and a million things about the car that I've noticed that bother me like chipped paint, cracked leather, cracked bumper yadiya and I will address everything but right now, I want to address the biggest elephant in the room which is, GDI. I will probably write something about this in my notes but from the research I've read, the 2015 VT gets a good amount of carbon buildup which can lead to knock, bad fuel economy and loss of performance amongst other things. As it sits my VT is at like 176.5 thousand km and I doubt any of the past owners have taken that point of failure into account and have done something about it. For some reason in Montreal, NO ONE does this service (carbon cleaning). I had been looking for like 3 weeks straight for a place that does korean walnut or dry-ice blasting but to no avail. Luckily, I called this european car shop called Strasse Autowerks, and they quoted me for 560 + tax and I have an appointment on the 20th @ 10 AM. I'm also booked at a Hyundai dealership for some recalls on my platform for ABS and underbody corrosion as well as normal oil change and inspection for like 120. I've also went ahead and bought the tools and parts required for spark plug replacement because I have no idea when was the last time they had been replaced. The spark plugs are some HKS M40XL for like 110$ from N75 motorsports (heard theyre busted). I'm pretty sure the spark plugs can also accrue carbon on top of just being worn out so just being safe. Han right now is still kind of rough, like I was driving it today and like it idles funny and riding feels like I'm constantly riding on gravel. I think that doing all of these maintenance services will drastically improve the feel of the car and ideally I want to have the car feel brand new. We'll see. (As of writing this SPARK PLUGS ARE COMING TMR WWW).

Okay so, I've been driving right and hit a MASSIVE pothole on the highway fml. Basically, I think this was already an issue but now it more noticeable but, the car at anything over 40km/h will stutter very slightly but enough to be annoying. Like it just makes the driving experience not fun. I know it's not the engine because it does this even when I ride the clutch so it's not the trans or engine (good thing). I'm looking at a set of sparcos and avan wheels on FB for 700 (actual steal) so I think the plan is : get those in like end february, install and get them balanced. While I install them, I'll take a look at the suspension and check what is out of whack. I really don't want to get new coilovers just yet because those are mad expensive and I wanted to do shifter upgrade and exhaust first (maybe exhaust first). I'm hoping it's just bad bushings and tie rods. If replacing those parts does the trick I'd be mega happy because Ideally I'd want to do coilovers in like fall or something. Also I was looking at the email I got from N75 and like, tuning will run me up 2k ðŸ˜…. 2k canadian though and I get 3 free revisions so like lowkey not horrible. I don't need a tune just yet but like when I do FMIC and WMI, that'll run me up like a solid 4k. Everything is coming together but DAMN that shit expensive. Rn though, mainly looking at wheels, and short throw shifters, nothing crazy crazy. Update coming soon `o7`.
