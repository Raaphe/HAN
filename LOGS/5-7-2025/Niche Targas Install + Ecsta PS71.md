I finally installed the niche Targas on the car. Few things. The holes for the lug nuts were just way too small for the 21mm socket. The lug nuts fit in the hole fine and I could get them started with my fingers but there was no way the socket was going to fit. I did some research and figured out that I could find lug nuts that fit the hub lugs on the VT that are smaller than the OEM 21mm lug nuts. So I put back the OEM wheel, went to canadian tire and picked up some M12x1.5 19mm lug nuts. They fit well and I was barely able to get the socket in the wheel lug hole but, managed to get all the wheels on. 

The wheels look great except for the amount of dirt and break dust they have caked on them. Furthermore, they currently have some bald 245/40/ZR18. The tires are super big and makes it feel like I'm driving a boat. Plus, especially when reversing, I'm pretty sure they rub because of how tall the sidewall is. I've been avoiding highways and such as to not die trying to break. Luckily, my step dad lent me some money for some Khumo Ecsta PS71 235/40/18 Ultra High Performance. I hope this will be a good balance of performance and comfort as I don't like the boat feel but also don't like feeling every nook and cranny of the Montreal roads. They come today (the 7th) and I have an appointment on Monday (idk the date) to get them installed.
