OK SO, about a week ago when I started the car to go back home from my internship, the dreaded CEL turned on. I hastily gathered enough money to get the code scanned. The light was a static CEL and when driving, nothing really stood out of the ordinary. These are the code I got.

After shitting a few bricks I relaxed and did some research on symptoms, possible causes and fixes. I started with spark by removing the spark plug and coil from cylinder 2 + 3 and inspecting them. The coil on cylinder 3 had a damaged coil connector and had dried electrical grease on the porcelain section. I compared the gap between both and the plug on cylinder 2 was at `0.30 inches`  and the one on cylinder 3 was at `o.28 inches`. So I gapped them both to `0.28` and threw the plug and coil from 2 to 3 and from 3 to 2. I erased the codes and I've been driving for 5 hours since and the codes haven't came back. Hopefully it will not come back on but as far as I'm concerned everything is fixed.
