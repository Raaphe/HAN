Did my first own oil change. May have put 0.3 US quarts too much but I monitored the level and everything seems fine. I used SAE 5W-30 full synthetic. The odometer showed about 181450km when I did the change and I'll do changes every 6k km since when I went to the dealership to get it done they had written I should do the next change 6k more than what I was at.

I have yet to buy break cleaner which I probably should. But yeah if it looks like I have a leak its just that I didn't clean the area out. I installed a copper washer and next time I do a change I'll most probably install a petcock for future changes

This was the OEM filter that the dealership installed when I went back in January :
