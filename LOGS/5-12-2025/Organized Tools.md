This isn't really anything that has to do with the car directly but, I live at my parent's still and I don't have anywhere to store my tools other than my room so everything was kinda scattered in a corner. I decided to use one of my dresser drawers to store everything this morning and everything looks a lot better in my room and also in the dresser.
