Few things have happened since last log. Recently I really got into power tools. I bought a 6mm brushless Milwaukee M18 impact driver with rapid charger and a C.P 1.5 battery for automotive application. After doing some research (whoops), I realized that my driver wasn't gonna be enough. I sold the driver, kept the battery and soon I'll invest in a proper Milwaukee mid torque 1/2 inch impact wrench. Later I can get other fancy stuff like maybe a Milwaukee dremmel thingy or angle grinder. Thinking I get one for cutting that 1/8 inch thick steel plate for the bumper sag fix. 

Recently (two days ago), I went to Ottawa to get some wheels!! Bought them off of marketplace from this guy called Adrien (super chill). Ottawa's roads are so much better and the car scene seemed more alive from the 3 seconds I was there. Anyway I got some Niche Targas in black and brushed aluminium. They are fairly curbrashed but I'm thinking I might be able to ChrisFix it and clean em up. They have tires on em but those are donezos. So next up in the wishlist is probably some hub centric rings and some new rubber. I have a tire guy that sold me winter tires for cheap I might contact. Like 1000 bucks would do me so much good right now mmm. 

Lastly, I'm currently at the Hyundai dealership in West Island. Getting the recall checked for underbody corrosion. The mister at the desk told me that what they'd do is check for any excessively corroded parts (do an inspection for free lol) and then replace any of those parts (free of charge self scammers). I don't get why they would do this because any car is prone to underbody corrosion right? Will not complain though. They also told me that if anything looks overly wrong that isn't rusted and be part of the warranty (word he used), they'd let me know without charging me off the rip. I have a meeting in an hour though I'm in the waiting room haven't eaten yet so can't wait to go home.
