This is a repository for my car! If you are someone that has found this because you purchased the car somewhere and are wondering what was done to it or maybe you are someone that knows me and are wondering the same thing, this is the place to look. Here I will log things I have done to the car both performance modifications and maintenance as well as references, future parts and plans as well as pictures of my car. I got the car from sketchy dealer place in Laval back in like October or November of 2024. This is my first car and for it having 175000km (108k miles) on it, I got it for a pretty good deal and I want to make it worth my while. I will take care of this car and have fun slightly pushing it (avoiding blowing it up) while learning many things. The car community (from the looks of it) seem to be dying off so I want to have a change at enjoying it before it does (hopefully it doesn't). Also, I think I am very privileged to have this car so it only makes sense to me to share my experience so that maybe it can inspire someone else as well or even help someone with the same or similar platform. When I got Han (work in progress name), The windshield was cracked, the battery was on it's last legs and it had some ugly ass vinyl basically everywhere (and has OEM rims). By the time someone buys it off of me (hopefully not anytime soon), I want to give that person peace of mind knowing their car is badass. More importantly though, I want my car to be badass, so I will work towards that goal. As of writing this it's disgusting and snowy outside so I really don't have any pleasant pictures of the car readily available. I'll add some more in the future but here are some below. Enjoy this ressource and have fun :)

The folders in this repository are :

```
\Images
\Logs
	\Performance
	\Maintenance
\Notes
Build Road Trip
Car Parts
README (this)
```

Images will hold all of the images found in my notes, logs will have photos and will act as a diary for any changes I make whether it be performance or maintenance services. Notes will hold more formal Notes I will write about this platform like fitment, ride height, issues, maintenance, etc etc. 

Build Road Trip Will act as a diary for my car and like future plans fully written out. Car parts will be a list of car parts I like to have saved, I'll leave a check mark noting whether the part is installed on the car. And of course, this readme as a little intro.

>I'm making this markdown project (or vault) using OBSIDIAN. I highly recommend downloading this if you have the opportunity to, to read this in the best format possible :)
