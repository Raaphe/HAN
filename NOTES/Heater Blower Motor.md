My heater blower motor makes a slight repetitive squeaking almost beeping noise. When it gets warmer I'll unscrew it and take a look to see if anything is obstructing it. I just replaced the cabin air filter last week and it was FILTHY, so maybe the blower has poopoo on it.

I removed the blower motor and I'm pretty sure it's just shot. Fan blades are stuck on the motor and I tried to oil up the bearings from under the motor and it's even worse now. I'll try to find one at a scrap yard now that I have more tools but yeah bearings are shot which was the source of the squeaking.
