I was watching a video on how you shouldn't mod your street car like a race car. I think I'll take this advice half-to-heart. I don't want to lose reliability and comfort in my car and also, usually, race car mods are pricier. For suspension, instead of opting for racing coilovers, I could get some upgraded springs and struts and pair that along with replaced OEM parts and maybe some sway bars for roll. These are the parts I'd consider :

# [Springs](https://eibach.com/product/4247.140?epsid=1461)

These look good and are (sorta) inexpensive. They're progressive, not too aggressive and drop only about 1". I've read that they improve stability while balancing comfort. On Eibach there's also sway bars if I ever want to add to this build.

# [Bushing Kit](https://kdmtuners.com/product/superpro-master-bushing-vehicle-kit-hyundai-kia/)

I have no idea what these are made of but looks like polyurethane. These would replace my likely shot OEM bushings and provide that *new car* feel. I might not get this kit but only bits (its super duper expensive wtf)

# [Ball Joint](https://www.autozone.com/suspension-steering-tire-and-wheel/ball-joint-lower/p/duralast-ball-joint-fa500236/1177257_0_0)

Probably have shot ball joint. This is replacement.

# [Outter Tie Rod](https://www.autozone.com/suspension-steering-tire-and-wheel/tie-rod-end/p/duralast-gold-steering-tie-rod-end-ges60202lf/1414486_0_0) & [Inner Tie Rod](https://www.autozone.com/suspension-steering-tire-and-wheel/tie-rod-end/p/duralast-gold-steering-tie-rod-end-ges800886lf/1414464_0_0)

These are also probably shot on the car and I want my shit to run like new. 

# [Front strut](https://www.amazon.ca/KYB-3330093-Gas-Strut/dp/B084Q8NT5N) & [Rear Struts](https://www.amazon.ca/KYB-554384-Just-Silver-Monotube/dp/B00C89QT6K/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_2/140-8725225-2293314?pd_rd_w=uAEOp&content-id=amzn1.sym.9286c396-f989-473f-a51f-aeb6f0ce4e48&pf_rd_p=9286c396-f989-473f-a51f-aeb6f0ce4e48&pf_rd_r=JP049FHHF1HQM7QF7ANV&pd_rd_wg=nHEho&pd_rd_r=c719edc6-a69b-4f73-8eac-982592f0ef23&pd_rd_i=B00C89QT6K&psc=1)

I was gonna opt for Koni yellows but they are WAYYY too expensive and I would've just ended up paying for coilovers at that point. These are the best balance of budget, responsive and ride comfort. Part numbers are 3330093 and 3330094 for fronts.

Not including the bushings, the price comes out to about : **1762$**

This price is minus the bushings and with taxes after US conversion (also assuming shipping is free).
