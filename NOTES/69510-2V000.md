Chat-GPT o4-mini-high reasoned this when being asked more detail on [this part](https://www.hyundaipartsdeal.com/genuine/hyundai-dr-assy-fuel-filler~2vf47-ac000.html). I'm getting next paycheck soon and really want a part but I also don't wanna break the bank too much. These have limited stock so I might bite as I really like the look and this would quench my thirst for a little while. I first read that it was an OEM part from [this forum thread](https://www.velosterturbo.org/threads/where-would-i-obtain-a-gas-lid-mod-similar-to-this-one.33919/).

On the first-gen Veloster (2011–2017), that “race-inspired” fuel-filler door wasn’t standard equipment at all but a Genuine Hyundai Accessories item you could tick off when ordering—or retrofit later through your dealer. It carries Hyundai part number **2VF47-AC000** (often cross-referenced as **69510-2V000**) and is sold through the Accessories catalog rather than being part of any factory trim package [Hyundai Parts Deal](https://www.hyundaipartsdeal.com/genuine/hyundai-dr-assy-fuel-filler~2vf47-ac000.html)[Hyundai Shop](https://hyundaishop.com/hyundai-veloster-fuel-door-aa017/?srsltid=AfmBOorQlJ-MtL6onwhW8wlR0JBsAt9bKE__aky_ybN3fdTUU94UH0mX&utm_source=chatgpt.com). Mechanically it’s identical to the stock door—same hinge, latch and release cable—but it’s molded with a brushed-alloy look and even laser-etched “Veloster” branding for a little extra flair [Hyundai Parts Deal](https://www.hyundaipartsdeal.com/genuine/hyundai-dr-assy-fuel-filler~2vf47-ac000.html).

The suffix **AC000** actually flags it as an **Accessory** part (rather than a pure service replacement), and the **2V** prefix ties it to the Veloster platform. Because it lives in the Accessories catalog—alongside things like mud guards, floor mats and cargo nets—it never appeared on the window sticker of a base car unless you opted in. Owners could have it painted to match their body color (or left its raw finish), but it was **never** part of the standard build [Veloster](https://www.veloster.org/threads/veloster-fuel-door-hyundai-accessory.63681/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Interestingly, very few buyers bit the bullet—forums still joke that spotting one in the wild is like seeing a unicorn. Even though Hyundai offered it in a stainless-steel finish, uptake was low (likely due to the extra cost and subtle effect), so genuine OEM fuel doors remain relatively rare on first-gen V-cars [Veloster](https://www.veloster.org/threads/carbon-fiber-fuel-tank-door.7243/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

Some people say it's rice and now I kinda see it but I'm still inclined to pick it up. I'll look for some pictures of

this one is really nice can't lie. I was under the impression that it wouldn't match the gray on the trim but it seems like it does.
