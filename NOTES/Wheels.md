I'm like brand new to the world of wheels and just today I was delving in known brands. I think if you're also new a great way to start is to read [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForteGT/comments/1fbcy3n/guide_to_acquiring_new_fancy_aftermarket_wheels/) which does an INSANE job at explaining wheels. Also, there's this picture below I found giving a rough idea of existing brands I found off of a bladedangel video :

As for what wheel's fit on the VT 2015 (gen 1s basically) This is the specs :

**WHEEL SIZE** : 18x7.5  +35 | 5 114.3mm | 67.1 mm

so the numbers here mean :

- **DIAMETER OF TIRE : 18 inches** | *cannot be over 19 btw ⚠️*
- **WIDTH OF TIRE : 7.5**  |  *I think 7 inches and 8.5 inches is the min and max could be wrong*
- **OFFSET : +35**  |  *35-40 is flush from forum's advice*
- **LUG NUT COUNT AND PATTERN : 5 114.3mm**  |  *this cannot be different ⚠️ *
- **BORE SIZE : 67.1mm**  |  *This can be bigger but will need hub centric ring. smaller is impossible :( ⚠️*

The torque spec for the lugs are : **80ft/lbs of torque**

For example this wheel fits but will need HUB CENTRIC RING to not be lug centric only.
