So, on the Hyundai Service website, when I put my VIN, there were two recalls on my car. One for an ABS fuse and another for "Underbody Corrosion". I wasn't sure what the second one was and I went in to get both done as well as oil back in January or something. That dealership (Coiteux I think) told me they didn't have what it takes to do the underbody corrosion recall. So I waited until the tenth of March 2025 to get it done. 

Once there, the guy (Alex) had told me that the recall was just an inspection of the underside of the car, and if anything were to be damaged from rust, it would be replaced free of charge. Furthermore, a treatment to stop rust in the feature was also done which is poggers.

Also, Alex had told me that if anything was spotted that is out of whack that isn't covered by the warranty of the recall they'd tell me about it and offer a service to repair (he told me my passenger rear calliper was seized and replaced it even when I told him I couldn't afford it lol).
