OK SO, I got my hands on a little bit of money after having sold my tires and bought some tools and upgrades that I will detail specifically in [[Radiator - Bumper Sag Brackets - 2962-20|The logs]]. Now that that is all bought, I have to pay off school, a toll bridge fee, my mom, taxes and my credit card so I'll stop splurging for a little while. I have a Lugia V #186 full-art that is worth a pretty penny that I want to get graded by CGC and sold on ebay ad im thinking I could get atleast 500 from that and another 1500 from the bourse (hopefully) which would again soften the financial hit when I get some tires. I'm looking at getting a few more things in the near future for maintenance and potential performance that being ;

parts:
- Serpentine belt
- Water pump
- MAYBE lightweight pulleys (depending on budget)
- Mesh Grill
- New coolant

tools:
- Spill proof funnel
- Set of chrome vanadium sockets with ratchet (marketplace find picking up tomorrow morning)
- Impact socket set

Then in the moderately far future I'm looking at doing body work and suspension work after I get my tires taken care of. I now am getting a good set of tools so suspension work (which was impossible with what I had before) is now something to consider especially with my bigass wrench I have now. I'd love to do what I wrote down in [[Suspension Rebuild]] paired with a cool alignment to make driving feel better and most importantly safer. Pretty sure my front shocks are gone and that my tie rods are gone too.
